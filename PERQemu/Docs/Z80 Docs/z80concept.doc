                            Dirk L. Kalp











    On July 30, 1981 an initial meeting was held to discuss  the
    design  of  the  new  Z80  system  software.  Attending this
    meeting were Brian  Rosen,  Don  Scelza,  John  Strait,  and
    myself.   This  report is intended as a brief summary of the
    ideas presented at that meeting and thus should serve  as  a
    preliminary  basis  for  the new Z80 system design.  Besides
    this meeting, some additional conversations with Don  Scelza
    and  John  Rose  have  contributed  to  both the clarity and
    substance of this report.  Hopefully, this  initial  concept
    document  for  the  new  design  will  stimulate  additional
    thought and discussion.  Any new ideas, suggestions,  criti-
    cisms,  and  comments concerning  the new Z80 design as well
    as this presentation will be appreciated.

The New Z80 System Design: Concept Document                13 Aug 81



____________ ___ _____INTRODUCTION AND GOALS

     The current Z80 subsystem has not proved  adequate  in  meeting
either  functional  requirements  or  performance criteria needed by
PERQ users.  While  proposed  solutions  to  this  problem  have  at
various times embraced hardware modifications to the PERQ I/O board,
the current strategy calls for effecting the necessary  improvements
through  software only.  The solution proposed requires a comprehen-
sive and simultaneous redesign and integration of the Z80 code,  the
PERQ  microcode,  and  the  Pascal I/O support code along with a new
specification for the PERQ<-->Z80 communication protocol.   A  major
consideration  in  this  new  design effort will be to adhere to the
established principles of software engineering  that  contribute  to
the  understandability  and,  thus, future usability of the software
produced.  The software should be responsive to future  modification
with  a  minimum  of effort in order to accomodate future changes to
the I/O board.

     Some of the goals  and  general  requirements  that  have  been
expressed for the new system design are:

  1. to  implement all the functions provided by the peripheral
     support chips.

  2. to modularize the Z80 code to make it  understandable  and
     maintainable.

  3. to  minimize  the size of the PERQ microcode and place  as
     much responsibility with the Z80 as possible.

  4. to maximize speed and flexibility with a minimum  expecta-
     tion of driving one device at a time at full speed.

  5. to  include some diagnostic capabilities to provide device
     status and error conditions to the user.

These points  will  be  further  elaborated  in  the  material  that
follows.




________  _________  ___ ___ _____PROBLEMS, SOLUTIONS, AND NEW IDEAS

     The  construction  of  the  current  Z80  software  system as a
monolithic state machine along with some rather  unconventional  and
subtle  programming  techniques have made maintainance of this soft-
ware an almost impossible task.  These conditions have prevented, or
have  at  least made extremely difficult, any attempt to incorporate
new functional components as  well  as  to  modify  those  existing.
While  this is not the only weakness of the current Z80 system, this
lack of maintainability is certainly a major obstacle  in  improving
the  current  system.   Thus a new system design should place a high
emphasis on facilitating maintainance.  This goal  can  be  achieved
through  the  standard  software engineering techniques of clear and


                              - 1 -

modular design of functional components,  well-defined  and  minimal
interfaces, and adequate specification and documentation.

     In large part, the redesign of the Z80 subsystem is necessitat-
ed by this lack of maintainability of the  current  system.   By  no
means,  however,  is  this  the  sole  factor.   Currently, the PERQ
microcode implements its own state machine to support the Z80 system
and  the communication protocol.  Much of this intelligence residing
within the PERQ more properly belongs within the Z80 software or is,
in  fact,  already duplicated by it.  Concentrating the intelligence
in the Z80 will help in the goal to minimize the size  of  the  PERQ
microcode.   Also,  a redesign of the communication protocol between
PERQ and Z80 should be made to improve the speed and  efficiency  of
the  communication  and  to  further  reduce the amount of microcode
needed to handle the protocol.

     Another significant problem within the  Z80  subsystem  is  the
ineffective  use of the DMA chip to handle data transfer operations.
Here the term, DMA, is something of a misnomer since  the  chip  can
directly handle not only transfers between peripheral and memory but
also between two peripherals.  Currently, only floppy data transfers
to/from  RAM  are  assigned  to  the  DMA chip with all others being
handled by the Z80 processor.  Clearly, relieving  the  Z80  CPU  of
this burdensome overhead and reserving the Z80 primarily for control
purposes will contribute to improved performance of  the  total  Z80
subsystem.   The  use of the DMA chip with the  PERQ I/O port should
also serve to speed communication and reduce the overhead associated
with  the  protocol  on  both the PERQ and Z80 sides.  Since several
"devices" (floppy, GPIB, PERQ I/O port, RS-232, and  speech  output)
will  be  competing for the DMA chip, a mechanism for scheduling the
use of the DMA chip must be implemented.  To  what  extent  the  DMA
chip  can  be  multiplexed  among  the  devices  to  meet their data
transfer needs is not yet clear; however, it is certainly   possible
to drive at least one device selected at a time at full speed.  This
device might be implicitly selected by the  type  of  user  activity
(eg.,  producing speech output from GPIB input) being performed with
user awareness that certain other devices (eg.,  PERQ  I/O  port  to
floppy) might not perform at full speed.

     In  connection  with  the  DMA  chip,  the RAM of 1K bytes also
represents a scarce resource that will need to be shared.  In  order
to  accomodate  the increased DMA activity, the need for addditional
RAM buffers will arise.  To  meet  this  requirement,  a  scheduling
mechanism  will also be needed to dynamically administer the availa-
ble RAM that is not permanently committed to system data areas.

     While the preceding has focused on  the  major  issues  in  the
redesign  effort,  several  other  areas in need of improvement have
also been addressed and are briefly  mentioned  here.   First  among
these  is  the  need  to  provide  the  user  with  some information
concerning device status changes and error  conditions.   While  the
current  system provides little support in this area, the new system
design would rely on exceptions to propogate this  information  back
to  the  user.  One feature included in the current system and to be
eliminated from the new design is the checksum.  The checksum,  used
to  verify  data  transmissions over the PERQ I/O port, is currently


                              - 2 -

unused and there  appears  to  be  little  reason  for  keeping  it.
Finally,  a  proposed  addition  to  the  new system is to include a
command to "execute" a buffer.  The intent  here  is  to  provide  a
facility for sending a segment of Z80 code to the RAM and scheduling
it for execution.  Certainly such an ad hoc mechanism must be viewed
as  a rather unsafe feature requiring careful handling; however, its
justification is based on its anticipated usefulness in  areas  such
as testing, patching code, and non-standard device support.




______ _________DEVICE SPECIFICS

     To  conclude  this  report,the  proposed  effect on each of the
devices in the new Z80 system design is briefly outlined here.


     ________     Keyboard

          The current ring buffered implementation is  satisfactory.
     On  the  PERQ  side,  the  raw  characters transmitted from the
     keyboard are translated by a function.   This  should  be  made
     table driven.


     ____ __ ___ _____     Time of Day Clock

          No change is required.


     _____ ______     Touch Tablet

          No support will be provided.


     ________ ______     Pointing Tablet

          This  is  currently  being handled through GPIB; but a new
     mouse will be developed and will be  supported  on  the  unused
     receive port on the speech half of the SIO.


     ______     RS-232

          We  must  be  able  to  handle  ASYNC,  BISYNC,  and  SDLC
     protocols and modem control.  Both sequential and block  trans-
     fer  modes  will  be  supported  requiring  the use of ring and
     message buffers respectively.  In the block mode and using DMA,
     full  speed  transmission of data at 56K baud must be provided.
     Sequential mode transmission is performed  without  DMA  and  a
     data  transfer  rate  of  9600  baud  will be possible.  Status
     updates on modem change and errors are required.

     ______     Speech

          We must handle 16KHz continuously, at least in the absence
     of other devices running.


     ______     Floppy

          Read,  write,  and  format a sector commands already exist
     but are very slow.  To increase  their  speed,  we  want  every
     other  floppy  sector  on  a  given track to be accessible in a
     single revolution (at least when no other devices are running).
     In  order  to provide flexibility in formatting floppy sectors,
     we require that PERQ be able to supply  the  format  specifica-
     tions  rather  than simply accepting the fixed formats supplied
     by the current Z80 software.  Additional commands to  read  and
     write  a track will be implemented and may require DMA with the
     PERQ I/O port.  These  commands  will  serve  as  a  basis  for
     developing  an  efficient PERQ utility to transfer the contents
     of an entire floppy to/from the hard disk.


     ____     GPIB

          All functions - talker, listener, and controller - must be
     implemented.   Serial  and  parallel  polling  must be handled.
     Like RS-232,  we  will  also  implement  sequential  and  block
     transfer  modes.   To  support  this,  we will augment the ring
     buffering with block buffering in order to permit DMA  control-
     led data transfer.


     ____ ____ __________     Hard Disk Addressing

          No change needed except, perhaps, for a simpler protocol.
