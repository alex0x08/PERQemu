PERQ <--> Z-80 Messages                                    14 Aug 81


__  ____________1.  Introduction

     This   document   gives  a  brief  description  of the messages
that are interchanged between  PERQ  and  the  Z-80   on   the   I/O
board.   The descriptions  give  the  syntax of the command, a brief
description of its function, and any restrictions.   Note  that  all
commands  begin  with  a  153  byte  which is not shown.  In all the
descriptions, <N> is a byte count.  An N of zero is  interpreted  as
256.  The <enable> byte has the low  order bit set if that device is
to be enabled, and clear if it is to be disabled.  The  remaining  7
bits  are  device  specific   and   should normally  be  zero.   All
numbers are octal unless they are terminated with a period.

     Whenever  PERQ  sends  a   message   that   requires   a   data
transfer,   no  further  transfer  messages, for that device, should
be sent until the Z-80 says that it is willing  to  accept  messages
for that device.





__  ____ __ ___ ________2.  Perq -> Z80 Messages



     ________ ____     RS232Out Char
     <001><N><char1><char2>...<charN>

               This   message   places   characters   into
          the  RS-232  output ring buffer.  The byte count
          <N>    must   be   less   than   or   equal   to
          sixteen.   The  Z-80  will  give  a  transmitter
          ready  status  whenever  there  are sixteen free
          bytes in the ring buffer.


     ______ _______     Floppy Command
     <002><head,unit><cyl><sec><cmd><N><Data0><Data1>...<DataN>

               The <head,unit>, <cyl> and <sec> bytes of a
          floppy   command   must be  in  the  same format
          that is expected by the NEC  floppy  chip.   The
          valid  values  for  the  <cmd>  byte of a floppy
          command are:
               1 - read  a sector of data.
               2 - write a sector of data.
               3 - format a sector.
               4 - seek to a cylinder.
          The  write  command  is  the only  command  that
          must   contain  valid  data.   This data will be
          written  to  the   floppy   in   the   specified
          sector.   All   writes  transfer   256  bytes of
          data to  the  floppy.   If  256  bytes  are  not
          provided  by  PERQ  then  the  remainder  of the
          sector will be written with  what  ever  is left

          in  the  buffer.  For all of the commands except
          Write a byte count of 1 must be specified.  This
          data byte will not be used.


     ____ _______     GPIB Command
     <003><cmd><N><Data1><Data2>...<DataN>

          The allowable  values  of cmd are:
               1 - write data.
               2 - write data with EOI on last byte.
               3 - write registers.
          The   first   two commands cause a data transfer
          on the GPIB bus.  N must be in the range of 1 to
          32.   The GPIB will not be marked as ready until
          all the bytes have been transfered.   The  third
          command  allows  PERQ to directly write into the
          TI-9914 registers.  In this command,  each  pair
          of  data  bytes  is  treated  as the first being
          a register number, and the second a data  value.
          The register numbers are:
                0 - Interrupt   Mask   0  (The  Z-80  will
                    always enable  BI  and  BO  with  your
                    data).
                1 - Address  Register
                3 - Parallel  Poll
                4 - Interrupt Mask 1
                5 - Serial Poll
                6 - Auxiliary Command
          Again, N must be in the range of 1 to 32.


     ______ _______     Speech Command
     <004><N><Data1><Data2>...<DataN>

               This  command  is  similar  to  the  RS-232
          output command except  that the  output  goes to
          the  speech channel.  The byte count (N) must be
          less than or equal to thirty-two.  The Z-80 will
          give  a  speech  ready status whenever there are
          thirty-two free bytes in the ring buffer


     _____ ______     RS232 Status
     <005><3><enable><clock><settings>

               This command sets  the  current  state   of
          the   RS-232  channel.  <clock>  represents  the
          baud  rate  (1 is 9600, 2 is 4800,  4  is  2400,
                                                  ________          etc.).   <settings> is the bit pattern  rrttsspp
          where:
               __               rr is number of bits per receive  character
                  (00  for  5, 01  for  7, 10 for 6 and 11
                  for 8).

               __               tt is  the  number  of  bits  per  transmit
                  character (same as rr).
               __               ss is   the   number   of stop bits (00 for
                  synchronus, 01 for 1, 10 for 1 1/2,  and
                  11 for 2).
               __               pp is the parity setting (00 for no parity,
                  01 for  odd,  11  for even).


     ______ ______     Tablet Status
     <006><1><enable>

               Turns   the   tablet   on   or   off.    No
          other  status settings are possible.


     ________ ______     Keyboard Status
     <007><1><enable>

               Turns  the keyboard on or  off.   No  other
          status  settings  are possible.


     ____ ____     Disk Seek
     <010><count>

               Performs  a seek of <count> cylinders.  The
          seek   complete  message  is  issued  after  the
          appropriate delay time based on  the  value   of
          <count>.


     _______ ________     Voltage Settings
     <011><N><enable><voltages>

               Enables   or  disables  voltage/temperature
          checking  and  sets  the  minimum  and   maximum
          allowable  values  (the   range  is  inclusive).
          The  values are specified as four bytes for each
          voltage/temperature.   The first byte is the low
          order minimum, the second  is  the  high   order
          minimum, the third is the low order maximum, and
          the fourth is  the  high  order  maximum.    The
          ordering  of  the voltages/temperatures  is:
               ground
               +5
               +12
               +12/-12
               Vref
               Network
               CRT
               base unit

               +55
               +24
          The  value   of   <N>   specifies  the number of
          data bytes in the command.  It may fall  in  the
          range of 1 to 51 (octal).


     _____ ______     Clock Status
     <012><1><enable>

               Turns  the  clock  on  or  off.   No  other
          status  settings  are possible.


     _______ ______     Request Status
     <013><flag>

               Requests  the  Z-80  to return  the  status
          settings  of  any  device.   The  <flag> byte is
          treated as a set of one bit flag   to   indicate
          which   device   statuses  are  being requested.
          The bit definitions are:
               001 - RS-232
               002 - Tablet
               004 - Keyboard
               010 - Voltage
               020 - Clock
               040 - Floppy 100 - GPIB
               200 - send status change


     ______ ______     Floppy Status
     <014><003><Density><  Heads><Interrupt enable>

               The Floppy Status command is  used  to  set
          the  status  of  the floppy.   <Density> is used
          to set the floppy to single or  double  density.
          A   0   indicates   single   density   while   a
          100(octal)  indicates   double   density.     < 
          Heads>   indicates  the number of heads that the
          floppy  has.   Valid  values  are   1   and   2.
          <Interrupt   Enable>    is   used   to  set  the
          interrupt status of the floppy.   If  interrupts
          are  disable  then   the   floppy  will  not  be
          able  to interrupt  the  Z80.   A  1   indicates
          that  interrupts  are  to  be allowed.  A 0 will
          disable interruptes.

     ______ ____     Floppy Boot
     <15>

               The Floppy Boot message is used to  request
          the  Z80  to read a boot file  from  the floppy.
          The  format  of  boot  floppies   is   described
          elsewhere.

     ________ ____     Keyboard Char
     <001><Char>

               <Char> is the eight bit value received from
          the keyboard.


     _______ ____     RS232In Char
     <002><2*N><Status1><Char1>...<StatusN><CharN>

               This   message   transfers  up  to  sixteen
          characters   received  on  the  RS-232  channel.
          <Char>  represents  the   eight   bit   quantity
          received.  The <Status> bytes have the following
          error bits:
               1 (bit 0) - parity
               2 (bit 1) - overrun
               4 (bit 2) - framing.


     ______     Tablet
     <003><Xlow><Xhigh><Ylow><Yhigh><count>

               This message reports the  X  and  Y  values
          from  the  tablet.   The tablet  switch  appears
          as  the  high  order  bit  of  Xhigh.    <count>
          represents  the  number  of  clock  ticks  (1/60
          second) elapsed  since the sending of  the  last
          tablet message.


     _____     Clock
     <004><count>

               This   message   reports   the   number  of
          clock ticks since the last clock message.  Note,
          this  message  is  used  only  when the clock is
          enabled and the tablet is disabled.

     ______ ____     Floppy Data
     <005><Status><N><Data1><Data2>...<DataN>

               This  message  is  used  to  transmit  data
          from  a  read  operation to PERQ.  The low order
          bit of the status byte  indicates  if  the  Read
          operation    completed   without   error.   A  1
          indicates that there was error.


     ____     GPIB (not implemented)
     <006><Status><N><Data1><Data2>...<DataN>


     _____ ______     RS232 Status
     <007><3><enable><clock><settings>

               Reports the  current  RS-232  status.   The
          interpretation  of <clock> and <settings> is the
          same as for the PERQ to Z-80 message.


     ______ ______     Tablet Status
     <010><1><enable>

               Reports the current status of the tablet.

     _______ _____     Voltage Error
     <014><024><current voltages>

               Reports   that   at   least   one   of  the
          voltage/temperatures was out  of the   allowable
          bounds.   The  values  are  reported in the same
          order as in the PERQ to Z-80  message  with  the
          low  byte   preceeding   the  high  byte in each
          case.


     _______ ______     Voltage Status
     <015><75><enable><current voltages><min/max settings>

               This   message  reports   the   status   of
          voltage/temperature  checking.   <current  volt-
          ages> reports the  current  values  (as  in  the
          voltage error  message),  and <min/max settings>
          give the lower and  upper  bounds  in  the  same
          format as the PERQ to Z-80 message.


     _____ ______     Clock Status
     <016><1><enable>

               Reports the status of the clock.


     ______ ______     Floppy Status
     <20><N><reg1>..<regN>

               This  message  is used to return the status
          of the floppy.   Up  to seven  registers  may be
          returned  by this message.  These are the status
          registers that are provided by the NEC chip.


     ______ ____     Floppy Done
     <21><Status>

               The floppy done message is used to indicate
          that    the    requested  floppy  operation  has
          finished.  The low order bit of this message  is
          used  to  provide  error status information.  If
          the  low  order bit  is  set  then  there was an
          error  during  the operation.  The Floppy Status
          command  can  be  used  to  get  more   detailed
          information  about  any  errors  that  may  have
          occurred.

               This message reports the status of the GPIB
          read registers at the last interrupt.  The order
          of the  registers  is:
               1 - Interrupt Status  0
               2 - Address Switch
               3 - Address Status

     ______ ____ _____     Floppy Boot Error
     <22>

               The floppy boot error message will be  sent
          anytime that there  is an  error  while  the Z80
          is reading a boot file  from  the  floppy.   The
          possible errors are:
               a) the floppy is  not  ready
               b) the floppy  is not a boot floppy
               c) any error reported by the floppy chip.


     ______ ____ ____     Floppy Boot Data
     <23><N><Data1>...<DataN>

               This  message  is  used to send a block  of
          boot  file  information from the  Z80  to  Perq.
          <N>  is  the  number  of  bytes  in the message.
          NOTE: in a Floppy Boot Data message a byte count
          of  zero means NO data  bytes.  A message with a
